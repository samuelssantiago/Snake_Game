Snake Game

/*
 Welcome to your brand new worm game!
 
 For those of you who have never played games before, you're in for a treat
  
 Movement is simple in this game, use the characters 'w' 'a' 's' and 'd' to go up, left, down, and right in that order.
 
 feeling extremely frustrated? Press 'q' to quit and keep the change!
 
 View LIVE the amount of time you've wasted away at the computer playing our game with the fantastic 'timer' feature located in the top right corner of the screen!
 
 Theoretically the worm should grow each time you eat some food, however our top notch development team prefers an air of mystery in our games, who knows what's going to happen as you move around the screen, embrace the unknown!
 
 See your score in the top LEFT corner of the screen!
